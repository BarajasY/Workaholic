# About
This repo served as a school project in the Web Programming class. During this course there were 3 main stages of development that were graded according to it's quality.

# First Stage - Planning
During this Stage it was essential to make mockups and explain correctly all (or most) of the features that the site would have. Basically planning from the start how the site would work.

# Second Stage - Database
In this stage the database model was taken into consideration. The relations, usefulness, good practices, etc... were graded.

# Third Stage- Coding
Lastly the third stage mostly consisted in coding the website from the ground up. During this stage there were multiple revisions to the code in order to ensure that the project was going well.

# Result
Once the course was finished i awarded myself the score of 100/100.
